## Status Log

### 2026-05-02 13:30 Asia/Shanghai

Current state:

- Existing workspace contains design documents only.
- No git repository was present at the start.
- `rg --files` was unavailable because the packaged `rg.exe` could not start due to Windows access denial; PowerShell file enumeration is used instead.
- Project direction chosen: Phaser + TypeScript + Vite browser vertical slice.

Decisions:

- First playable pass will focus on Zhao Yun and Diao Chan.
- Chapter focus is 第一章：洛水残照.
- Core systems are combat, card execution, map nodes, rewards, rest, shop, and events.
- First art pass will use procedural ink landscape, CSS/SVG brush frames, and silhouette-style character presentation to reach the preview image direction quickly.
- Full generated character art is deferred unless needed after playable layout proves stable.

Next step:

- Create workflow configs and scaffold the Vite/TypeScript/Phaser project.

Verification:

### 2026-05-02 13:21 Asia/Shanghai

Current state:

- Git repository initialized.
- Runbooks and agent configs committed as baseline commit `19d87dc`.
- Vite, TypeScript, Phaser 3.90, Vitest, jsdom, and Playwright test dependencies installed.
- App shell, Phaser host, HUD host, and a procedural ink battlefield placeholder created.

Decisions:

- Phaser was pinned to 3.90.0 after `npm install phaser` initially selected Phaser 4. The prototype uses Phaser 3's stable API.
- First smoke test covers shell creation before deeper game state work.
- Phaser scene remains presentation-only; no gameplay rules are in the scene.

Verification:

```text
npm test -- --run tests/app-shell.test.ts
Result: 1 test file passed, 1 test passed.

npm run build
Result: TypeScript and Vite build passed.
Note: Vite warned that the Phaser bundle chunk exceeds 500 kB. This is expected for the first prototype and does not block the milestone.
```
